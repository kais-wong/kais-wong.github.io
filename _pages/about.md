title: "About Me"
---


I was born and raised in Southern California. I attend Princeton University where I study Economics. Currently I am studying abroad at the SILS at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.

My academic interest is mathematical modeling. My currently projects include modeling physical phenomenon using diffusion equations and using stochastiv processes to simulate asset movements.

I'm also interested in Japanese language and culture. I have been studying Japanese language for 2.5 years.

My hobbies are reading, cafe hopping, trying new foods, and learning about new cultures. I practice Kyudo, a form of archery and traditional Japanese martial art.

I have traveled to Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and South Korea. I love traveling and hope to travel more in the future.

I was born and raised in Southern California. I currently attend Princeton University where I study ORFE (Operations Research and Financial Engineering). Last year, I studied abroad at Waseda University's School of International Liberal Studies in Tokyo, Japan.

My academic interest is computer/mathematical modeling. My current projects include modeling physical phenomena using diffusion equations and using stochastic processes to simulate asset movements.

I'm also interested in Japanese language and culture. I have been studying Japanese language for 2.5 years.

My hobbies are jigsaw puzzles, reading, cafe hopping, trying new foods, and learning about new cultures. I practice Kyudo, a form of archery and traditional Japanese martial art.

I have traveled to Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Mainland China, and South Korea. I love traveling and hope to travel more in the future.
